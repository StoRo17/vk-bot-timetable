# Timetable for subjects VK bot

This project was developed to improve skills and only for educational purposes,
but it works fine (I hope).

## About bot
This bot is waiting for a request (user message to it) to handle it and return the timetable of subjects on,
for example, a certain day or for today/tomorrow.

It uses [VK Callback API](https://vk.com/dev/callback_api) and works in VK communities.

For now it only works with the timetable of [my study group](https://vk.com/ivtmpu).
